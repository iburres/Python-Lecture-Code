    print welcome message
    Ask the user their name
    Ask the user for the year they were born
    convert string from input to integer
    Subtract year they were born from current year
    print the difference, which is a rough estimate of the user's age

#Declaring and Initializing variables
#variable names can't start with a number, can't have spaces, can't have special characters.
#variable names should be descriptive and meaningful

#strings
students_name = "Alice"  # This is a variable of type string, since it contains only characters
students_ID = "784564"   # This is also a string.  The nunbers in the string are just symbols. Can't do math!!
_num = 5

#integers
num_of_students = 40
median_age = 24

#floating point values (floats)

interest_rate = 4.35567 # floating point values have 32-bit representation

#processing data (= means assign,  == means equal)
num_1 = 55
num_2 = 66
result = num_1 + num_2 # this line adds the two numbers on the right and then stores the sum into variable result

# doing math with different data types is fine, as long as they are numbers (int, float, double, etc)
# However, if we add a number with a string using + then we are actually concatenating the values.  This means
# chaining together.

#correct way to concatenate
