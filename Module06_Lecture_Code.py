open() function = open a file.  You can use this to create a file with the "w" mode. 
close() function = close a file
with open() as file: = Can be used to open a file and automatically close it when the block is done.  This is a good way to handle files. However, you cannot create a new file with the with statement.  The file must already exist!!!!
