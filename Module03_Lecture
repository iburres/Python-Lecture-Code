# Python decision structures
# if, if-else, if-elif-else.  Boolean expressions.  Logical operators.  Nested if statements.

# if statement
# if <condition>:    The header must evaluate to True or False
#     <statement>    Notice the indentation

#.lower() converts the string to lowercase.  .upper() converts the string to uppercase
if (user_choice.lower() == "yes"): 
    print("You chose to continue.")
  

# if-else statement
if user_choice == "no":
    print("You chose to stop.")
else: # else is optional
    print("You chose to continue.")

# if-elif-else statement

# logical operators
# and, or, not
# >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
# truth tables
# T and T = T   I am 5.9 feet tall and I am 45 years old
# T and F = F   I am 5.9 feet tall and I am 4 years old
# F and T = F   I am 4 feet tall and I am 45 years old
# F and F = F   I am 4 feet tall and I am 4 years old
# T or T = T    I am 5.9 feet tall or I am 45 years old
# T or F = T    I am 5.9 feet tall or I am 4 years old
# F or T = T    I am 4 feet tall or I am 45 years old
# F or F = F    I am 4 feet tall or I am 4 years old

# Now let's use the logical operators in our if statements
