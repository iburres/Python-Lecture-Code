     Module 12 - Recursion
        
        Important information:
        
        Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself.
        
        Anything that can be done with recursion can also be done iteratively and vice versa.
        
        Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems.
        
        Recursion "can" be slow and typically uses more memory (due to the overhead of maintaining the stack), so it is not always the best solution. (Iterative solutions are often faster and typically use less memory.)
        
        Recursion uses a base case to stop the recursion.
        
        Recursion uses the call stack to keep track of function calls.

# Pseudo code Iterative solution for factorial of 4:

# now reduce n by 1 for pass through the loop

# accum = 12
# accum * (n)
# Take the number and multiply by 1 less than the number.
# Store that value into accumulator

# This function demonstrates the use of dynamic programming to solve the Fibonacci sequence. The difference between this function and the previous one is that this function uses a list to store the values of the Fibonacci sequence as they are calculated, which allows the result to be retrieved in constant time. This is an example of memoization, which is a technique used to store the results of expensive function calls so that they can be retrieved later without having to recalculate them.
