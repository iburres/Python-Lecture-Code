     Module 12 - Recursion
        
        Important information:
        
        Recursion is a technique in programming where a function calls itself.
        
        Anything that can be done with recursion can also be done iteratively and vice versa.
        
        Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems.
        
        Recursion can be slow and use a lot of memory, so it is not always the best solution. (Iterative solutions are often faster and use less memory.)
        
        Recursion uses a base case to stop the recursion.
        
        Recursion uses the call stack to keep track of function calls.

#4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

# Pseudo code Iterative solution for factorial of 4:
# accum = 4, and n = accum - 1
# now reduce n by 1 for pass through the loop
# accum * (n) = 12
# accum = 12
# accum * (n)
# Take the number and multiply by 1 less than the number.
# Store that value into accumulator
